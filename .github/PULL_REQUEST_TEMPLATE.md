### Pre-submission checklist:

*Please check each of these after submitting your pull request:*

* [ ] Are you only including a `repo_url` if your project is 100% open source? If so, you need to pick the single best GitHub / GitLab repository for your project, not a GitHub organization.
* [ ] Have you picked the single best (existing) category for your project?
* [ ] Have you included a URL for your SVG or added it to `hosted_logos` and referenced it there?
* [ ] Does your logo clearly state the name of the project/product?
* [ ] Does your project/product name match the text on the logo?
